# Mardi-Graa-project
The holiday of Mardi Gras is celebrated in all of Louisiana, including the city of New Orleans.

Celebrations are concentrated for about two weeks before and through Shrove Tuesday, 

the day before Ash Wednesday (the start of lent in the Western Christian tradition).

Usually there is one major parade each day (weather permitting);
